# Phase 2 Pressure Benchmark

This benchmark builds a fixed 24-object synthetic catalog and runs the
sequential Architect/Coder/Debugger retry trace under calibrated GPU KV
pressure.

The primary run uses:

- client-observed first non-empty-token TTFT;
- `max_tokens=1`;
- one warmup trace with a distinct cache salt;
- cache flush and a clean metrics baseline before measurement;
- a final cache flush and reset-state comparison;
- boundary-only Prometheus scraping to avoid perturbing the next request;
- a fixed three-object probe cohort across all pressure points;
- frozen object IDs and request order across independent server restarts.

Run from the immutable SM75 image with the source and Hugging Face cache
mounted read-only and a separate writable results mount:

```bash
python3 -m benchmark.approx_kv.run_phase2_matrix \
  --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
  --model-revision c1899de289a04d12100db370d81485cdf75e47ca \
  --source-git-sha <phase2-git-sha> \
  --image-digest sha256:0be6e16e2eb288dfd5fa8b0b41015f61731a139fb961d3366ccedf834289d781 \
  --output-dir /results
```

The default matrix is `rho=0.8/1.0/1.5/2.0/3.0` with three independent
server restarts per point. The runner never removes an existing result
directory and refuses to write into a non-empty directory.

`rho_reusable` is based on the unique token trie for stable reusable prefixes.
`rho_physical` additionally estimates all measured prompt branches and one
generated token per request. Synthetic dense/recovery cost fields are metadata
for later trace validation and are not measured recovery costs.

## Phase 3 HiCache canary

Start SGLang with hierarchical cache plus:

```text
SGLANG_ENABLE_UNIFIED_RADIX_TREE=1
SGLANG_APPROX_KV_CORE=1
SGLANG_APPROX_KV_HOST=1
SGLANG_APPROX_KV_PREFETCH=1
```

Then run:

```bash
python3 -m benchmark.approx_kv.run_phase3_canary \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:30000 \
  --model-revision c1899de289a04d12100db370d81485cdf75e47ca \
  --model-fingerprint Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B@c1899de289a04d12100db370d81485cdf75e47ca \
  --output /results/phase3-canary.json
```

The canary uses the Phase 2 object generator and verifies host export, async
H2D, full-layer copy, mismatch fallback, reset-induced store miss, exact-Radix
isolation, and final KV-pool accounting.

## Corrected Phase 4 R2 key rerun

`run_phase4_cacheblend_key_rerun.py` remeasures the ratio-1% body1024/2048
cells with three server restarts and paired dense baselines.

For each raw/fresh chunk, the runner:

1. incrementally materializes `header + body[:chunk_end]` in an isolated
   exact-cache namespace;
2. registers only the current <=512-token chunk from those exact KVs;
3. applies rho=2 pressure;
4. re-seeds the target head and runs the real CacheBlend target.

The result reports target-only, fresh-adapter-combined, request-path and
full-lifecycle ledgers separately, plus first-token equality, mechanism
counters, eviction, fallback and pool-reset evidence.

Committed result:
