# Phase 2 Pressure Benchmark

This benchmark builds a fixed 24-object synthetic catalog and runs the
sequential Architect/Coder/Debugger retry trace under calibrated GPU KV
pressure.

The primary run uses:

- client-observed first non-empty-token TTFT;
- `max_tokens=1`;
- one warmup trace with a distinct cache salt;
- cache flush and a clean metrics baseline before measurement;
- a final cache flush and reset-state comparison;
- boundary-only Prometheus scraping to avoid perturbing the next request;
- a fixed three-object probe cohort across all pressure points;
- frozen object IDs and request order across independent server restarts.

Run from the immutable SM75 image with the source and Hugging Face cache
mounted read-only and a separate writable results mount:

```bash
python3 -m benchmark.approx_kv.run_phase2_matrix \
  --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
  --model-revision c1899de289a04d12100db370d81485cdf75e47ca \
  --source-git-sha <phase2-git-sha> \
  --image-digest sha256:0be6e16e2eb288dfd5fa8b0b41015f61731a139fb961d3366ccedf834289d781 \
  --output-dir /results
```

The default matrix is `rho=0.8/1.0/1.5/2.0/3.0` with three independent
server restarts per point. The runner never removes an existing result
directory and refuses to write into a non-empty directory.

`rho_reusable` is based on the unique token trie for stable reusable prefixes.
`rho_physical` additionally estimates all measured prompt branches and one
generated token per request. Synthetic dense/recovery cost fields are metadata
for later trace validation and are not measured recovery costs.
